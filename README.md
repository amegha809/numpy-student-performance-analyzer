# numpy-student-performance-analyzer
This project is a beginner-to-intermediate level Python application built using NumPy to analyze and manipulate student academic performance data. The project uses a 2D NumPy array to store marks of multiple students across different subjects and performs various data analysis operations.

It demonstrates practical usage of core NumPy concepts such as array creation, indexing and slicing, axis-based statistical computations, boolean masking, vectorized operations, reshaping and flattening arrays, insertion and deletion of rows and columns, copy vs view behavior, and sorting data based on computed metrics.

The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of NumPy by applying its features to a real-world–like dataset, making it a hands-on learning exercise for data analysis fundamentals.
